# Bulls-Cows-Game-Console-

This is a simple console-based implementation of the Bulls and Cows guessing game in Java. The game generates a secret code with a specified length and set of symbols, and the player needs to guess the code based on the feedback provided.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**:
   - Enter the length of the secret code.
   - Input the number of possible symbols in the code.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Start making guesses according to the code length and valid symbols.
   - Receive feedback on each guess indicating the number of bulls and cows.

3. **Win Condition**:
   - If your guess matches the secret code, you win!

## Features

- Error Handling: Handles various input errors and provides relevant error messages.
- Dynamic Symbol Range: Adjusts the symbol range display based on the number of possible symbols.
- Gameplay Loop: Continues until the player guesses the code correctly.

## Usage

- Ensure you have Java installed.
- Compile the `BullsAndCows.java` file.
- Run the compiled `.class` file in a console.
